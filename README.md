# Longcache

Longcache will set Cache-Control headers for CDNs / reverse proxies to cache WordPress pages for a long period of times (days+). As such this plugin also handles invalidations on content updates, to FLUSH the CDN / reverse proxy on page changes.

This is a work-in-progress.

## Todo

- Delete post / transition should trigger invalidate.
